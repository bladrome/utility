Many choices of
- read mapping
- preprocessing
- postprocessing

** Current problem

*** (preprocessing + read mapping + postprocessing)
*** (paired-end or single-end)
** Work (Contribution)
*** Simulation
- 3 datasets
*** Comparision
- 3 preprocessing methods
- 5 postprocessing methods
- 5 read mapping algorithms
- paired-end & single-end
- short reads & long reads

** Introduction

DNA methylation (observed in various diseases, especially cancers)
- CG context (~80% of CG dinucleotides)
- C *H* G or C *H H* context (~3%; *H* =A, T, or C)
WGBS bisulfite treatments
- converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils
- leaves methylated cytosines intact
# So problems are: *Mapping and Assess*

** Pipelines
1. adapter removal
2. read quality trimming
3. read mapping
4. postalignment read filtering
5. sample heterogeneity assessment
6. identification of differentially methylated regions

* Material and methods
** Genome annotations and WGBS data sets
UCSC genome database
- chr21, hg19
- allele freq. of SNPs
- annotated repeats
- annotatated segmental duplications
WBGS libraries Gene Expression Omnibus
- SRR901864: 101nt single-reads (single-end data)
- SRR568015: 45nt and 50nt paired-end reads (A)
- SRR771408: 100nt paired-end reads (B)

** Benchmark data
# - Simulated bisulfite converted reads
*** Factors
- (CG, CHG and CHH)
- (SNPs and indels)
- paired-end, single-end
- bisulfite conversion (99% reads)
- seq error
- sequencing depth (down-sample)

** Preprocessing: trimming methods
*** Mott trimming
移除3'至最小累积质量分数部分
    # The  3' portion  of  the  read  starting from   the   position   with
# the   minimum   cumulative   score   is trimmed
*** Dynamic trimming
要求窗口内每一位置质量分数高于预设值
    # The quality scores of each position in the window exceed a preset
# threshold
*** Simple trimming
若某一位置质量低于预设值，丢掉该位置及3'端剩余部分
    # As soon as it detects a position with quality scores below a preset
# threshold, it discards this position and the remaining positions at
# the 3' end of the read
** Mapping:bisulfite-seq mapping algorithms
*** bismark (bowtie, bowtie2)
Three letter
*** BSMAP
Wild-card
*** GSNAP
Wild-card
*** BRAT-BW
Three letter
*** LAST
Wild-card

** Postprocessing: filtering methods
*** Coverage filtering
 Computed  methylation  levels for cytosines covered by at least n
 reads. n=3, 5 and 10.
*** Quality filtering
 Use reads that covered cytosine and had quality scores greater than
 or equal to q at this position. q=10, 20

** Evaluation of performance
*** mapping accuracy

$$ mapping\, sensitivity =  \frac{\#correctly\, mapped\, reads}{\#all\, simulated\, reads} $$
$$ error\, rate =  \frac{\#incorrectly\, mapped\, reads}{\#all\, simulated\, reads} $$

*** methylation level estimation
  - Cs correctly covered　（正确覆盖的Cs）
    - Cs perfectly estimated　（正确估计的Cs）
    - the error of estimated methylation levels (估计甲基化水平的错误率)
  - Cs falsely covered　（错误覆盖的Cs）

# ** Repetitive regions & platform
** Performance in repetitive regions of the genome
the youngest and the least diverged　（不成熟，最小分歧）
- Alu elements: AluY subfamily
- LINE elements: LINE-1P bsubfamily

The fractions of simulated reads in all data sets that fell in the repetitive regions within chromosome 21 were:
- 0.48–1.21% in AluY
- 2.54–5.34% in LINE-1P
- 0.05–0.20% in AT-rich lowcomplexity regions (LCR)
- 0.05–0.15% in GC-rich LCR
- 0.02–0.10% in other LCR
- 1.70–3.41% in segmental duplications

** Runtime and memory usage
- CPU: (Dell R815 AMD Opteron 6380, 2.5GHz)
- RAM: 512 GB


* Results
** Mott trimming improves mapping accuracy
# Figure A
# Trimming tended to increase sensitivity but sometimes slightly
# increased error rete Reads trimming is especially effective in
# increasing the sendsitivity of mapping longer reads
# Large improvement:Mott trimming for Bismark with Bowtie2
# Small improvement:Mott trimming for Bismark with Bowtie

** Paired-end information helps accurate mapping of short reads

- For shorter reads, paired-end information improved the sensitivity
  for Bismark,  GSNAP  and  LAST,  at  a  small  cost  of  errorrate.
- For longer  reads, LAST showed a slight improvement and GSNAP showed
  a noticeable  improvement  in  the  paired-end  mode
- The mapping algorithms differ in their efficiencies of using paired-end information.


** Mott triming imporoves the accuracy of methylation level estimation consistently
*** Metrics
    - The fraction of Cs correctly covered
    - The average  error  in  estimating  methylation  levels  for  the  Cs  correctly covered
    - The number of Cs falsely covered

* Discussion
** Overall recommendation
   - Mott  trimming + (Bismark or LAST) without any further filtering
   - other alignment  algorithms may still be useful in practice, e.g. LAST
   - Paired-end sequencing for short read lengths (e.g. 50 nt)
   - single-end sequencing for long reads (e.g. 100 nt)
   - paired-end sequencing for repetitive regions

** Limitation of benchmark data sets
   1. contaminant DNA sequences
   1. adapter sequences
   1. DNA degradation
   1. fragment length (uniform distribution?)
   1. Differential methylation levels of CpGs in different locations

** Object
*** Preprocessing
    - Mott trimming
*** Mapping algorithms
    - LAST (Best performance,  Adaptive seeds of variable lengths)
    - Bismark comparable with LAST

*** Postprocessing methods
   - Coverage filtering with cutoff 3 can eliminate inaccurate
     methylation estimation originating from a few wrongly mapped
     reads.
   - Quality filtering with quality score cutoff 10 is the most
     effective  postprocessing method, when not combined with Mott
     trimming.

** Possible enhancement for methylation level estimation at low sequencing depth
***   Use BSmooth as postprocessing
   - smoothing may miss individual cytosines that exhibit sharp changes
     in methylation levels within the genomic block (平滑淹没个体特异峰值)
   - it can greatly aid the detection of differentially methylated
     regions in low-coverage samples. (可侦出差异甲基化区域)


** Summary
*** Key Points
  - Whole  genome  bisulfite  sequencing  (WGBS)  analysis　steps that
    included 192 combinations of preprocessing,　mapping  and
    postprocessing  methods  were  evaluated  using  simulated
    single-end  and  paired-end  data  sets　that closely matched
    experimental WGBS data sets.
  - Mott    trimming    for    preprocessing    combined
    with Bismark   or   LAST   for   mapping   without   any
    further postprocessing  showed  the  best  accuracy  on
    methylation level estimation.
  - Paired-end sequencing reduced errorr and enhanced   sensitivity
    for   both   read   mapping   and methylation level estimation,
    especially for short readsand in repetitive regions of the human
    genome.

** THE END
